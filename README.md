# 🎙️ Speech Emotion Recognition 

A deep learning-based system to classify human emotions from voice using **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** techniques. This project leverages digital signal processing and advanced classification models to identify emotional states from audio signals.

---

## 🧾 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing speech signals to recognize emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **fearful**, and more. Using key SER datasets and machine learning, it builds an end-to-end pipeline from audio feature extraction to model prediction.

**Project Duration:** April 2023 – September 2023  
**Focus Areas:** Feature extraction, classification, real-time prediction  
**Datasets Used:** CREMA-D, RAVDESS, SAVEE, TESS
